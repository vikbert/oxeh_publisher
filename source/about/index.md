### @Xun Zhou

Hi, Iâ€™m `@Vikbert` and I am working as senior software engineer and living with my Family in Berlin, Germany. Actually is Vikbert a `cyber-name` originates from the names of my two kids (`Vik`toria) & (Al`bert).

### I believe

that developers who sincerely want to improve the quality of software enjoy themselves in these they created. That is why I made the transition from a promising academia career to professional software engineering.

### I work

to make web a beautiful place. I craft beautiful designs and convert them into fully functional and user-friendy web app. The essential technologies I am working with can be found on my personal website.
